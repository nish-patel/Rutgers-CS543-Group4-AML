# Graph-Cities
This repository contains code for [*Graph Cities*](https://rutgers.box.com/s/w6goff66f8zl9u5hgo3u3qmbra3yh7ro). Graph Cities are 3D visual representations of partitions of a graph edge set into maximal connected subgraphs each of which is called a fixed point of degree peeling. Each such connected subgraph is visually represented as a Building. A poly-log bucketization of the size distribution of the subgraphs represented by the buildings generates a 2D position for each bucket. The Delaunay triangulation of the bucket building locations determines the street network. We illustrate Graph Cities for the Friendster social network(1.8 billion edges), a co-occurrence keywords network derived from the Internet Movie Database (115 million edges), and a patent citation network(16.5 million edges). Up to 2 billion edges, all the elements of their corresponding Graph Cities are rendered in few minutes (excluding I/O time). The actual Graph Cities computation takes about 2 hours on a 64 GB RAM commodity computer. Our ultimate goal is to provide tools to build humanly interpretable descriptions of any graph, without being constrained by the graph size. It consists of four sub-modules: `wave-decomposition`, `Graph_City_Web`, `fpViewer` and `graph-strata`.

Web interactions are fully tested using Chrome. There are some issues with Safari. Therefore, we recommand for the current version to only use Chrome as a browser. A video illustrating our current interface can be accessed at [here](https://rutgers.box.com/s/53ewby3qi64cdwus6ctbv2x3u6664h68).

## Quick Start
### Clone Graph City Infrastructure
You may clone this repo just by typing the following line in your console:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/endlesstory0428/Graph-Cities.git
```
This will create a Graph City work space folder `Graph-Cities`. We refer to this folder as "Work Space" `./`.

### Compile Graph City Infrastructure
Before you start creating your own Graph City, you first need to compile "Graph Cities Infrastructure".
#### Compile `wave-decomposition`
In this version, we provide compiled binary files that one can directly use them after making them executable by the following lines.
```bash
cd wave-decomposition
chmod +x buffkcore; chmod +x cc-layers-mat; chmod +x DAGMetaNode_touch; chmod +x edgeCutCompress_touch; chmod +x entropy; chmod +x ewave_next; chmod +x fpmetagraph; chmod +x gridmap; chmod +x lccBuck; chmod +x preproc; chmod +x topSrc_touch; chmod +x waveCC_touch; chmod +x waveFragLevel_touch; chmod +x waveFragLevel_touch_bucket; chmod +x wavelayercc_direct; chmod +x wavemaps; chmod +x wavemapsWaveByWave; chmod +x filterBirdHorse; chmod +x filterGorilla;

```

~~Under your Work Space './', type the following commands in your console to compile `.cpp` files.~~
```bash
cd wave-decomposition
make
```
#### Link sub-modules
Under your Work Space './', type the following commands in your console to create soft links among the four sub-modules
```bash
ln -s $(pwd)/wave-decomposition $(pwd)/Graph_City_Web/
ln -s $(pwd)/wave-decomposition $(pwd)/fpViewer/
ln -s $(pwd)/fpViewer $(pwd)/Graph_City_Web/
ln -s $(pwd)/graph-strata $(pwd)/wave-decomposition/
```
#### Set Up Graph Cities Host Server
Under your Work Space `./`, type the following commands in your console to configure your server address and ports.
```bash
python3 config.py -a ${server_address} -c ${graph_city_port} -s ${graph_strata_port}
```

Under your Work Space `./`, type the following commands in your console to set up the "Graph Strata" server.
```bash
cd ./graph-strata/
mkdir data
npm ci
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

Under your Work Space `./`, type the following commands in your console to set up the "Graph Cities" web application server.
```bash
cd ./Graph_City_Web/
ln -s $(pwd) $(pwd)/public
mkdir data_dags
npm ci
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=65536"
node app_addon.js
```

### Build Your Own Graph City
#### Input Graph
Input your graph into the folder `./wave-decomposition/${DATASET}/`. The Graph Cities Infrastructure accepts two files as inputs: 
- **Graph Topology**: An ASCII edge list file `${DATASET}.txt` where each line is a pair of integers separated by a tab, 
- **Vertex Labels**: (Optional) a header-free CSV (following `RFC 4180` standard) vertex label file `${DATASET}_label.csv` with two columns:  `vertex_index`, `vertex label`.

Your directory file structure should be as follows:
```bash
./
├── wave-decomposition/
│   ├── scripts/
│   ├── src/
│   └── ${DATASET}/ #your input graph
│       ├── ${DATASET}.txt #pairs of integers separated by a tab
│       └── ${DATASET}_label.csv #header-free CSV
├── Graph_City_Web/
├── fpViewer/ 
└── graph-strata/
```
#### Process Decomposition
Under your Work Space `./`, type the following commands in your console to process your input graph.
```bash
cd wave-decomposition/
make GRAPH=${DATASET} prepare

cd ../Graph_City_Web/
make GRAPH=${DATASET} retrive
```
A detailed explanation of the commands above can be found in the [wave-decomposition section](#wave-decomposition) and [Graph_City_Web section](#graph_city_web).

#### Browse a Graph City
Use your web browser to access the following webpage containing your Graph City ready for exploration.
```bash
http://${server_address}:${graph_city_port}/?city=${DATASET}
```

## Commands
For an input graph `${DATASET}` residing in `./wave-decomposition/${DATASET}`, a simple one-shot command to process it is the following:
```bash
make GRAPH=${DATASET} prepare
```
This make program automatically invokes the following commands:
### Graph Decomposition Phase
#### Preprocess Input Graph

- The following make program preprocesses the input graph as a bidirectional binary edge list, and outputs the vertex degrees `${DATASET}.deg` and connected components `${DATASET}.cc`.
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} union
```
#### Iterative Fixed Points Edge Decomposition
- The following make program applies the "iterative edge fixed point decomposition" to the preprocessed graph, and outputs a folder containing the "edge fixed point decomposition" results `${DATASET}_layers/`
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} decomp
```
#### For each Fixed Point, generate its Wave/Fragment Vertex Decomposition
- The following make program applies the "wave-fragment vertex decomposition" to fixed points, and outputs a folder containing results `${DATASET}_waves/`
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} dwave-all_next
```

The "wave-fragment vertex decomposition" of a **single** fixed point can be invoked as follows:
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} LAYER=$(FIXEDPOINT) dwave_next
```
#### Map connected Waves to connected Fixed Points
- The following make program computes connected fixed points, and obtains a mapping from each connected wave to its corresponding unique connected fixed point. The updated outputs are stored under `${DATASET}_layers/` and `${DATASET}_waves/`.
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} cc-layers-uf
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} wave-layer-cc_direct
```
### Information Collection Phase
#### Log Bucketization
- The following make programs and python scripts collect connected fixed point information and generate a mapping from connected fixed point ids to log bucket ids. The output consists of three collections of files:
    - `graph-*-*.json`: connected fixed point information in each bucket.
    - `lcc-duplicates.json`: a mapping from a representative connected fixed point to a list of connected fixed points with the same number of vertices, edges, and the fixed point value as the representative one.
    - `${DATASET}-info.json`: log bucket information.
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} fp-info_int
$(PYTHON) scripts/test/lcc-json2csv.py ${GRAPH}
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} bucket_int
```
#### For each Fixed Point generate its Buildings
- The following make program collects wave-fragment decomposition information as building information under the `${DATASET}_waves/` folder.
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} wavemap_cpp
```
#### Generate City Summary Sculpture Geometry
- The following make program collects iterative edge fixed point vertex local degree `localDeg.csv`, computes vertex diversity, and generates summary sculpture information as `${DATASET}-layers-dists.json`, and `${DATASET}_entropy.json`.
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} sculpture_int_cpp
```
#### Generate Vertex Intersection Graph
- The following make program computes "iterative edge fixed point vertex intersection graph" and generates "road network" information as `${DATASET}-fpmeta.csv`, `${DATASET}-fpmeta.ids`, and  `metagraph_normalized.txt`.
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} intersection_int_cpp
```
#### Generate City Grid Map
- The following make program collects connected fixed point information, and generates grid map information as `building2bucket-${DATASET}.json`, `${DATASET}-bucket2peels.json`, `${DATASET}-lccBuck.l-lcc-b.csv`, and `${DATASET}-lccWaves.vBuck.b.p.mm.json`.
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} gridmap_cpp
```
#### Generate Buildings/Bushes Geometry & Spiral City Layout
- The following make program generates the Graph City main view geometry files in the folder `cityMesh/`. This geometry is derived from the building information contained in the folder `${GRAPH}_waves/` 
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} geom
```
#### City Information Summary
- The following make program generates summary information in the file `${DATASET}-summary.json`, and distribution plots `${DATASET}_*.png`.
```bash
$(PYTHON) scripts/freqUsed/getCityInfo.py ${GRAPH}
$(PYTHON) scripts/test/getBestPlot.py ${GRAPH}
$(PYTHON) scripts/test/getLccDist.py ${GRAPH}
```
#### For each Fixed Point Generate Meta-DAGs
- The following make programs generate internal building structures represented as Meta-DAGs. Outputs are contained under the folder `dag/`.
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} frag-dag-touch-all
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} top-src-span-touch-all
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} wcc-compress-touch-all
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} wave-frag-compress-touch-all
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} edge-cut-compress-touch-all
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} frag-buck-compress-touch-all
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} dag-size
```
### Visualization Postprocessing Phase
#### Bucketize Connected Fixed Points according to Logarithmic Buckets
- The following make program splits wave-fragment decomposition results according to logarithmic buckets under folder `${DATASET}_waves/`
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} lccBuck;
```
#### Update Building Interior Information
- The following python scripts modify buildings' information according to their interior Meta-DAG structure. The result is stored under the folder `cityMesh/`
```bash
$(PYTHON) scripts/test/addDagInfo.py ${GRAPH}
$(PYTHON) scripts/test/checkLargeNode.py ${GRAPH}
$(PYTHON) scripts/test/addBuckESize.py ${GRAPH}
```

#### Filter large Meta-nodes for preprocessing of Minicity Rooms
- The following make program filters wave-fragment decomposition results according to Meta-DAG structure under folder `${DATASET}_waves/`
```bash
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} filterLarge-all;
make GRAPH=${GRAPH} filterSmall-all;
```

## Limitation of fpViewer
The number of waves per connected fixed point should be no larger than 50, the number of fragments per wave should be no larger than 60, and the number of edges of each fragment should be no larger than 8192. This in effect allows the fpViewer to process fixed points with at most `50 * 60 * 8192 = 24,576,000` edges provided that a suitable parameterized hierarchy tree for the fixed point is pre-computed. In this release, the provided fpViewer is able to handle detailed visualizations of non-regular general graphs with at most 131,072 edges provided all of its fragments have no more than 8192 edges. The purpose of fpViewer is to locally explore medium-sized graphs that consist of fixed points with about 3,000 "small" fragments. This is feasible by using the intersection graph of the iterative edge fixed point vertex sets.

# graph-strata
A full documentation for Graph Strata is availiable [here](https://fatimaalsaadeh.com/projects/Documentation.pdf).

There are some issues with Safari. Therefore, we recommand for the current version to only use Chrome as a browser.

## Limitation of Graph Strata
The number of edges of the input graph should be no larger than 16,384. The purpose of Graph Strata is to locally explore small-sized graphs with variaty algorithms including iterative fixed point decomposition and wave-fragment vertices decomposition in a layered view.
