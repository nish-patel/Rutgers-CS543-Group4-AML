# DAG Cover explanation

DAG Cover takes as input wave levels (or another nonnegative-integer-valued property) on vertices, and computes the edges that are in the same level or between adjacent levels. The DAG Cover visual tool will draw the DAG Cover edges in color according to wave level, and hide other edges by default.

The Pumping button enables showing extra edges going to lower levels from vertices in every level in the DAG Cover, from the top to bottom level. Left clicking it shows the next level. Right clicking it starts an animation that gradually shows all the levels. Right clicking it again stops the animation.
