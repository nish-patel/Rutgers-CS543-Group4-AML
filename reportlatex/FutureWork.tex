\begin{itemize}
    \item{Attempt to utilize a graph convolutional neural network to predict if a transaction is a money laundering transaction or not.}
    \item{A key benefit of using graphs as the data type (as mentioned in the question \(1\)) is to be able to utilize the relationships between accounts to identify potential fraud}
    \item{Given 90\%+ false positive rates using traditional methods, graph convolutional neural networks should be able to utilize the context of the relationships to produce lower false positive rates.}
