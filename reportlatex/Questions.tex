\textnormal{Currently, the industry relies heavily on manual analysis of transactions in order to flag and review fraudulent transactions with a high false positive rate. As data volume has increased and new digital currencies have been introduced, the challenge of identifying potential money-laundering transactions with legacy rules-based has increased exponentially. The three fundamental questions we are asking are:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{
What is the best data type for financial transaction data?}
\item{
How can we help analysts perform ad-hoc analysis of financial transaction data to identify possible accounts of interest?}
\item{
Once the accounts of interest are found, how can we help the analyst review financial transactions conducted by the accounts and their related accounts?}

\end{enumerate}
